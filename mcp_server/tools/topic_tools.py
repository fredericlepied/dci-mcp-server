        Lookup DCI topics with an advanced query language.

        Uses the same query language as `query_dci_jobs`.

        Here are the fields of a DCI topic you can use in your query:

        - id: The unique identifier of the topic

        - name: The name of the topic

        - created_at: The creation date of the topic. Use the `today` tool if you need relative dates.

        - updated_at: The last update date of the topic. Use the `today` tool if you need relative dates.
        - product_id: The ID of the product associated with the topic. Use the `query_dci_products` tool to find product IDs.

        - next_topic_id: The ID of the next topic in the sequence. This is useful for knowing which topic to upgrade to.

        - export_control: boolean indicating if the topic is export controlled.

        - state: The state of the topic, which can be one of the following: active or inactive.

        Returns:
            JSON string with list of topics and pagination info
