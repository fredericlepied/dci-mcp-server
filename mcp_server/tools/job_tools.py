        Lookup DCI jobs with an advanced query language.

        The query language is based on this DSL:

            eq(<field>,<value>) to lookup resources with a <field> having the value <value>.

            You can use the comparison functions gt (greater than), ge (greater or equal),
            lt (less than) or le (less or equal) using the same syntax as eq: <op>(<field>,<value>).

            like(<field>,<value with percent>) and ilike(<field>,<value with percent>)
            to lookup a field with a SQL glob like way. For example, to get the jobs
            with a CILAB- jira ticket number, use like(comment,CILAB-%).

            contains(<field>,<value1>,...) and not_contains(<field>,<value1>,...)
            to lookup elements in an array. This is useful mainly for tags.

            and(<op1>(...),<op2>(...)), or(<op1>(...),<op2>(...)) and not(<op>) allow
            to build nested boolean queries.

            null(<field>) to lookup resources with a field having a NULL value.

        Here are all the fields of a DCI job that can be used in the query:

            - id: unique identifier

            - name: name of the job

            - status: The current state  (new, running, success, failure, error, killed). Finished jobs have a status of killed, success, failure, or error. Failing jobs have a status of failure or error.

            - created_at: The creation timestamp. Use `today` tool to compute relative dates.

            - updated_at: The last update timestamp. Use `today` tool to compute relative dates.

            - team_id: The ID of the team associated with the job. Use the `list_dci_teams` tool to get it.

            - topic_id: The ID of the topic associated with the job. Use the `list_dci_topics` tool to get it.

            - remoteci_id: The ID of the remote CI associated with the job. It represents the lab. Use the `list_dci_remotecis` tool to get it.

            - product_id: The ID of the product associated with the job. Use the `list_dci_products` tool to get it.

            - pipeline_id: The ID of the pipeline associated with the job. Use the `list_dci_pipelines` tool to get it.

            - previous_job_id: The ID of the previous job in the pipeline.

            - tags: list of tags associated with the job. Daily jobs refers to a daily tag.

            - status_reason: explanation of the failed job. It is a free text field.

            - comment: free text. Can contain a JIRA ticket number.

            - url: The URL associated with the job can be a GitHub PR URL or a Gerrit change URL

            - configuration: the configuration of this job (which configuration was used in the lab)

        **Counting Jobs**: To get the total count of jobs matching a query, set `limit=1` and read the `count` field in the `_meta` section of the response.

        **Example for counting MyTeam jobs**:
        ```json
        {
          "query": "eq(team_id,615a5fb1-d6ac-4a5f-93de-99ffb73c7473)",
          "limit": 1
        }
        ```
        This will return a response like:
        ```json
        {
          "jobs": [...],
          "_meta": {"count": 880},
          ...
        }
        ```
        The total count is 880 jobs.

        If an URL is needed for a job, returns https://www.distributed-ci.io/jobs/<id>.
