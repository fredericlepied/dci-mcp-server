        Lookup DCI components with an advanced query language.

        The query language is based on this DSL:

            eq(<field>,<value>) to lookup resources with a <field> having the value <value>.

            You can use the comparison functions gt (greater than), ge (greater or equal),
            lt (less than) or le (less or equal) using the same syntax as eq: <op>(<field>,<value>).

            like(<field>,<value with percent>) and ilike(<field>,<value with percent>)
            to lookup a field with a SQL glob like way. For example, to get the components
            with a specific name pattern, use like(name,ocp-%).

            contains(<field>,<value1>,...) and not_contains(<field>,<value1>,...)
            to lookup elements in an array. This is useful mainly for tags.

            and(<op1>(...),<op2>(...)), or(<op1>(...),<op2>(...)) and not(<op>) allow
            to build nested boolean queries.

            null(<field>) to lookup resources with a field having a NULL value.

        Here are all the fields of a DCI component that can be used in the query:

            - id: unique identifier

            - name: name of the component

            - type: type of the component. `ocp` is the type of component for OpenShift release components.

            - team_id: The ID of the team that owns the component. Use the `query_dci_teams` tool to get it.

            - released_at: The release timestamp. Use `today` tool to compute relative dates.

            - topic_id: The ID of the topic associated with the component. Use the `query_dci_topics` tool to get it.

            - state: The current state of the component (active, inactive, etc.).

            - url: The URL of the component, if applicable.

            - tags: list of tags associated with the component. For components of type ocp, it has a build status tag like `build:dev` (also called engineering candidate or ec), `build:candidate` (also called release candidate or rc), `build:ga` or `build:nightly`.

        **Counting Components**: To get the total count of components matching a query, set `limit=1` and read the `count` field in the `_meta` section of the response.

        **Example for counting components by type**:
        ```json
        {
          "query": "eq(type,ocp)",
          "limit": 1,
          "offset": 0,
          "fields": []
        }
        ```
        This will return a response like:
        ```json
        {
          "components": [],
          "_meta": {"count": 150},
          ...
        }
        ```
        The total count is 150 components.

        Returns:
            JSON string with list of components and pagination info
